package rest.skeleton.spring.boot.config;

/**
 * Application configuration layer.
 *
 * Contains Spring {@code @Configuration} classes and supporting components:
 * - Security (filters, properties, JWT service)
 * - OpenAPI/Swagger configuration
 * - Database startup verification
 * - Actuator/logging settings (via application-*.yml files)
 *
 * This package should stay free of business logic and focus on wiring and runtime concerns.
